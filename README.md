The goal of this project was to create a free Google Calendar add-on that enables tracking of how you spend your time on the daily. This was motivated by a friend that had kept accurate records of how he spent his time for several months and was surprised at the results.

However, the project was not completed. I ran into a major blocker with Google's existing API access. It does not provide enough accessibility to create such a product, although Google does already offer a paid version that is well integrated.
